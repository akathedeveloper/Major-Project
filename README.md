# ðŸ§  Multi-Agent AI System (MVP)

This project is an **MVP architecture for a multi-agent AI system** that combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Computer Vision**, and **Knowledge Retrieval** with a modular design.  

At the core is a **Root Master Orchestrator** that delegates tasks to specialized **Sub-Masters** (NLP, Vision, Knowledge, Pricing). Each Sub-Master controls multiple **Sub-Agents**, enabling distributed and scalable execution.  

The system leverages:
- **LangChain** for orchestrating NLP pipelines,  
- **ResNet & Vision Agents** for feature extraction,  
- **Vector Databases (Pinecone/Qdrant/Weaviate)** for semantic search,  
- **Metadata & Knowledge Stores** for structured retrieval,  
- **Pricing & Business Logic Engines** for decision-making.  

It is designed with a **cloud-ready, fault-tolerant architecture**, using messaging queues, schedulers, and observability tools to ensure smooth operation.  

This forms the foundation of a **scalable, intelligent multi-agent platform** that can be extended into production-ready applications.
